- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization features to ensure the safety of your application.
- **Hibernate & JPA**: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools for database interaction, allowing easy mapping between Java objects and database tables.

## üåü Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Users can securely log in and register using encrypted passwords with Spring Security.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different user roles with different permissions to control access to resources.
- **REST API**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless interaction with the database using Hibernate and JPA to perform CRUD operations with ease.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Built to handle a growing number of users and requests.
